<br/>
This dataset provides a snapshot of the electric vehicle (EV) market in countried across the world from 2010 to 2024. It includes historical data on EV sales, stock, and market share, categorized by vehicle mode (e.g., cars), powertrain type (BEV, PHEV), and metric (e.g., stock share, sales share). The data helps in understanding the initial adoption trends of electric mobility.

In the machine learning part, I have done two models-Random Forest Regressor and XG Boost. I have calculated the model scores for both the models. Proper data preprocessing has been done along with removal of outliers. Encoding of categorical data has been taken care of.

For the EDA part, proper visualisations have been done to show the trends obtained graphically.
